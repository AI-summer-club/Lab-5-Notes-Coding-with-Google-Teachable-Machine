# Building a Simple RAG System for Your Portfolio Website

## Introduction (15 minutes)

### What is a RAG System?
- Definition: Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Purpose: Enhancing AI responses with relevant information from a knowledge base

### Why Use RAG for Your Portfolio Website?
- Personalized responses to visitors' queries
- Showcase your projects and skills dynamically
- Demonstrate your understanding of AI and NLP concepts

## Part 1: Understanding the Components (30 minutes)

### 1. Knowledge Base
- What is a knowledge base?
- How to create a simple knowledge base for your portfolio
- Exercise: Students write short descriptions of their projects

### 2. Retrieval System
- Introduction to vector embeddings
- Similarity search basics
- Simple implementation using Python and a library like sentence-transformers

### 3. Generation System
- Introduction to language models (e.g., GPT-3.5)
- How to use APIs for text generation
- Prompt engineering basics

## Part 2: Building the RAG System (45 minutes)

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
- Installing necessary Python libraries
- Setting up API keys (if using external services)

### Step 2: Creating the Knowledge Base
- Converting project descriptions to vector embeddings
- Storing embeddings efficiently

### Step 3: Implementing the Retrieval System
- Writing a function to find relevant information based on a query
- Testing the retrieval system

### Step 4: Integrating the Generation System
- Connecting to a language model API
- Crafting prompts that incorporate retrieved information

### Step 5: Putting It All Together
- Creating a simple interface for the RAG system
- Testing the complete system with sample queries

## Part 3: Integration with Portfolio Website (20 minutes)

### Frontend Integration
- Basic HTML/JavaScript for user input
- Sending requests to the RAG system

### Backend Integration
- Setting up a simple server (e.g., using Flask)
- Handling requests and returning responses

## Conclusion and Q&A (10 minutes)

### Recap of Key Concepts
- The power of combining retrieval and generation
- Potential improvements and extensions

### Open Floor for Questions

## Additional Resources
- Links to further reading on RAG systems, NLP, and web development
- Sample code repository for reference

## Code Snippets

Here are some example code snippets to support the lecture:

### 1. Creating Embeddings

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

projects = [
    "A machine learning model to predict stock prices",
    "A web scraper to collect data from news websites",
    "A mobile app for tracking personal finances"
]

embeddings = model.encode(projects)
```

### 2. Simple Retrieval Function

```python
import numpy as np

def find_relevant_info(query, embeddings, projects):
    query_embedding = model.encode([query])
    similarities = np.dot(embeddings, query_embedding.T).flatten()
    most_similar_idx = np.argmax(similarities)
    return projects[most_similar_idx]
```

### 3. Generating Response (using OpenAI API as an example)

```python
import openai

def generate_response(query, relevant_info):
    prompt = f"Query: {query}\nRelevant Info: {relevant_info}\nResponse:"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

### 4. Simple Flask Server

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/query', methods=['POST'])
def handle_query():
    data = request.json
    query = data['query']
    relevant_info = find_relevant_info(query, embeddings, projects)
    response = generate_response(query, relevant_info)
    return jsonify({'response': response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Remember to adapt these code snippets based on the specific libraries and APIs you choose to use in your implementation.
